This directory holds the distribution for ps-watcher, a program for
montoring a system via ps-like commands.

Short instructions. Type:
  cd ps-watcher-*
  make

If make fails you probably need to get IniConf. It it works then...

  ./ps-watcher --nosyslog --log --config ./samples/sample.ini

Read the documentation to understand what you did.

Documentation is in docs directory. 

All of the source code is covered by the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE. See COPYING for details on this.

To use the program you will need Perl version 5.003 or greater 
installed and the following modules:

   Sys::Syslog
   File::Basename 
   Config::IniFiles
   Getopt::Long 

The only one of these that is not part of the core Perl distribution 
is Config::IniFiles which can be found at:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Config/

In order to run the program you'll need a configuration file to 
use. Some samples configuration files can be found in the samples 
directory. See the README in that directory for a description of 
what the configuration files do.

See INSTALL for generic GNU configure instructions.
