Thanks to various people I worked with at the Associated Press who
have made suggestions. 

This program uses Config::IniFiles (originally called IniConf). Thus
thanks are due to Scott Hutton.  Rich Bowen (rbowen@rcbowen.com) now
maintains Config::IniFiles and incorporated my changes to the program that
allow regular expressions to be specified in "section" heads.

Dave Humes - reporting regression between 1.04 and 1.05 in termination
code and why.

James R Grinter <jrg at acm dot org> suggested and provided code to allow the
program to fire when no matching processes (e.g. when a process that
should be running has died).

Thanks to Jason Welsh <jason at monsterjam dot org> for helping to track down
a Solaris problem where ps returned multiple lines of output.

Thanks to Iñaki Sánchez for the patch that allows one to use $ps_pat in
the action statement.

Musicological supervision by Stuart Frankel <gecko@dustyfeet.com>,
