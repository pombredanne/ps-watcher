  Portablity fixes - Now runs on FreeBSD.

  with scripts that list the interpreter rather than the script name.

Changes from 0.95 to 0.96:
  Bug in running make dist.

  Small documentation bug in manual and HTML. Had @PROGRAM@ rather than
  @PACKAGE@ so name of package was not in man/html.

  Give example where you want to match all processes except one.

  Print out errors in configuration file

  configure.in -> configure.ac (thanks, autoconf)

  Config::IniConf now gives a syntax error for empty section: [].
  Change that.
 

Changes 0.93 - 0.95

Make "occurs = none" mean to run if there are no matching ps processes.

ps-watcher 0.93 -- first general release.
