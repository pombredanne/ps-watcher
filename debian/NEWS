ps-watcher (1.08-1) unstable; urgency=low

    moved startup to the end of the boot process and terminating to the
    beginning of the shutdown process

    If you modified the order of ps-watcher runlevel scripts for your own, this
    adjustment will not happen automatically and you have to handle it for
    yourself.
