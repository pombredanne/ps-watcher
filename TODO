AIX and Linux ps allow custom output lines which means we can enclose
fields in quotes and thus allow variables which have embedded
blanks. Should make use of that.

For now we only can handle one configuration file.  Should allow many.

Use IPC::Open3? -- it preserves STDERR and STDOUT. Backtick (`cmd`)
doesn't seem to.

Add more regression tests.
